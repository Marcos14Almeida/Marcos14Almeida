### Oi, eu sou Marcos 👋


- 🔭 AI'm currently doing a master's degree in artificial intelligence applied to optical fiber networks at Unicamp.
- 👨‍🏫 I am an Electrical Engineer graduated from Unicamp, an Electronics Technician and in 2019 I studied in Lisbon, Portugal, at Instituto Superior Técnico.
- 💰 I founded a startup called Davai App, a music social network. I was the developer and lead the UX/UI development of this music social network, for people to form bands, friendships, go to concerts together and much more. You can download it from the PlayStore.
